Create an app with 10 routes:
a root route that says "You have reached My amazing App?" or whatever you want it to say, lol
a set of /api routes that requires middleware and an api key that you come up with like the exercise. You need the following routes: A. /api that shows "Welcome to my API",  B. /api/dashboard that shows "This is the Admin Dashboard", C. /api/profile that shows "This is the API Profile Screen", and D. /api/jigglypuff that shows "Tishana is correct, Jigglypuff IS the best Pok√©mon". REMEMBER to add an error message if person is FORBIDDEN
a /greetings route that takes the name in the URL and says "Hello, <person name>!"
a /8ball route that generates a "Magic 8 ball" like message. Don't know what that is? check out this site: Magic 8-Ball
a  set of /boss routes that uses middleware to check if you are the boss before allowing you to get to the /boss/dashboard , /boss/profile , and /boss/destruction routes. Be creative with these... ALL BOSS ROUTES SHOULD BE LOGGED WITH TIMESTAMP
